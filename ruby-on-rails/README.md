Assumption is that a recent/current version of Ruby on Rails is installed. To install:

    $ brew install rbenv ruby-build
    $ rbenv install 2.5.0
    $ sudo gem install rails -v 5.1.4

If your experience is like mine just now (May 2, 2018), thisâ€™ll probably get you Ruby 2.3.3 and Rails 5.1.6

Before running benchmark for the first time, you might need to prime the gem pump:

    $ cd ruby-on-rails
    $ rails server
    ^C
